For some reason, when I first tried to sync that last commit, it said it was made by Kodek! If you don't know who that is, look dat shit up. Anyway, I looked at my configure git options, and sure enough, it said I was BuildTools (Kodek)! I have updated my git options, but sorry to Kodek, if you are reading this.
